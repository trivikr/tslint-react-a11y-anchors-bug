# tslint-react-a11y-anchors-bug

This repository tries to reproduce bug with `tslint-microsoft-contrib` rule `react-a11y-anchors` when `href="tel:1-234-567-8900"` is passed, but not successfully able to do so.

- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build`

The build is successful, but it fails on one of my private projects.
